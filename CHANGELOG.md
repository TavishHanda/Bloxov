# Changelog

Versions are `0.PHASE.CHANGE`: a new roadmap phase bumps the middle number, every change after that bumps the last.

## 0.3.3 (first real art)
- Loot crates use the hand-made Blender crate model (16 px/m texture, Bloxov palette) instead of colored boxes
- Pixel-art models get crisp "nearest" texture filtering and matte materials automatically (`scripts/pixel_model.gd`)

## 0.3.2 (movement: noise, crouch, stamina)
- Footsteps: you hear your own steps, and scavs hear them too. Sprinting carries ~15 m, walking ~7 m, crouch-walking is silent. Landing is loud (~10 m)
- Scavs have footsteps, so you can hear them coming
- Crouch (C, toggle): 1.8 m/s, lower camera, smaller target, tighter spread. Sprint or jump to stand up
- Stamina: ~8 s of sprint, jumps cost stamina. Run dry and you can't sprint until it recovers to 25%. Bar shows under your HP when not full
- Scavs aim at your actual chest/eye height, so crouching behind cover matters

## 0.3.1 (movement pass)
- Slower, heavier movement: walk 3.4 m/s (was 5), sprint 5.6 m/s (was 8.5); slower backwards and sideways
- Sprint only works moving forward, lowers the gun across your body, and adds a small FOV boost
- Gun takes 0.3 s to come up after sprinting before you can fire (no more instant stop-and-shoot)
- Jumps are lower (~0.6 m) with very little air steering, a short cooldown, and a brief slowdown on landing
- Shooting in the air is much less accurate
- Head bob, strafe lean and landing dip on the camera; bigger gun bob while sprinting
- Getting shot pushes you less
- Scavs miss more when you're sprinting (same as before, now tied to actually sprinting)

## 0.3.0 (Phase 2: the loop)
- Raids: 10-minute timer, random spawn point, 2 of 3 extracts open each raid (green beam + name)
- Stand in an open extract for 7 seconds to get out; running out of time = Missing in Action
- Loot containers: crates outside, lockers in buildings, safes in the bunker (loud to crack). Hold E to search
- 14 items across 5 rarities (yes, including the Golden Toilet), ammo boxes, bandages and medkits
- 10-slot backpack (Tab): items take 1-4 slots; take, drop, put back, use
- Dead scavs drop a bag you can loot
- H heals with the best-fitting bandage/medkit (takes time, can't shoot meanwhile)
- End-of-raid screen with your loot, its value, and session totals
- HUD: raid timer, bag value, search prompts and progress, extract list (O)
- Starting reserve ammo lowered to 90, so ammo boxes matter

## 0.2.3
- Version number shown in the menu and the top-right corner
- This changelog; releases are tagged in git

## 0.2.2
- Web builds are cache-busted and the page reloads itself when a newer version is deployed (fixes Brave/Chrome showing an old build)

## 0.2.1
- Esc pause menu with volume and mouse sensitivity sliders (saved between sessions)
- Zombie rushers replaced by armed scavs: radio callout when they spot you, 3-round bursts, range-based accuracy, strafing
- Red arrow showing which direction you're being hit from

## 0.2.0 (Phase 1: move + shoot)
- Rifle: full-auto, spread and bloom, recoil, reload, headshots, tracers, muzzle flash, impact sparks, damage numbers, hit and kill markers
- Practice dummy in front of spawn
- Rusher enemies that chase and punch, and explode into voxels
- Health, ammo, damage flash and death screen
- Generated placeholder sound effects
- Automated gameplay test in CI

## 0.1.2
- F3 debug overlay (FPS, mouse input)
- Mouse is no longer re-captured on every click

## 0.1.1
- Fix camera randomly snapping in Chrome (raw mouse input + spike filter)

## 0.1.0 (Phase 0: setup)
- Godot project with a first-person controller
- Gray-box town: roads, buildings, crates, extraction markers
- Automatic web build and deploy to GitHub Pages
